## [Research Statement](The_Impact_of_ACA_and_Same_Sex_Marriage_Legalization_on_ART.pdf)

## Job Market Paper
* [**"Another Baby Boom? How Same-Sex Marriage and the Affordable Care Act Increased Births in the US"**](/files/The_Impact_of_ACA_and_Same_Sex_Marriage_Legalization_on_ART.pdf)

Assistive Reproductive Treatment clinics use various procedures to help patients facing infertility issues, or same-sex couples, have children. Using CDC Data, I find that in states with ART insurance mandates, the Affordable Care Act caused an increase of 114-119 frozen births per clinic, due to frozen births being the cheapest procedure. Additionally, same-sex marriage legalization boosted frozen donated births by 6-10 births per clinic, and is driven by same-sex couples uptake of ART. However, these effects diminish at the clinic level due to an increase in the number of clinics following these policy changes, and an exhaustion of the demand.

## Working Papers

* [**"The Impact of Same-Sex Marriage Legalization on Adoptions"**](/files/The_Impact_of_Same_Sex_Marriage_Legalization_on_Adoptions.pdf)

The legalization of same-sex marriage (SSM) in the United States had many economic impacts on households. This paper aims to investigate the impact of SSM legalization on adoptive households across the United States, using the staggered legalization of states. Using ACS data from 2008-2016, this paper views this impact on households of men and women in same-sex relationships. This paper finds that women in same-sex relationships have a downward trend of adopting. This paper additionally, finds that women in same-sex adoptive households have higher income by 20 percentage points after legalization of SSM, compared to women in non-adoptive same-sex households.

* [**"Resume Audit Study on the Impact of Pronoun use on Resumes"**](/files/Resume_Audit_Study_on_the_Impact_of_Pronoun_use_on_Resumes.pdf)

Resume Audit Studies (RAS) are one of the only ways to document the existence of discrimination within hiring practices through callback rates. In this paper, I will attempt to run a RAS to look into the use of pronouns on resumes. The first branch of results will investigate whether including pronouns on your resume will decrease the rate by which an employer requests more information. Building on this, the second branch will investigate whether the state and current LGBT+ laws protect these individuals. After this, the final addition will examine the effects of different industries by their census gender makeup.
