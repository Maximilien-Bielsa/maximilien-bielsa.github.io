<hr>

I am a PhD Student in the Department of Economics at the University of Delaware. 

My current research explores how the ACA and same-sex marriage laws affect family structures by influencing the use of assisted reproductive technology and child adoption. Additionally, I conduct a resume audit study examining the effect of pronouns on resumes.

My research interests include Labor Economics, Health Economics, and Experimental Economics with a particular focus on LGBT+ Individuals and households.
